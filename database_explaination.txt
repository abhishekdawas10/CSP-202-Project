commits
Each commit is identified globally through its sha field. If the author or the committer has not configured his email address, no resolution to a user entry is possible. 

The project_id field contains a link to the project that this commit has been first associated with. This might not be the project this commit was initially pushed to, e.g. in case the fork is processed before the parent. See project_commits.

The parent commit(s) for each commit, as specified by Writr.

The commits belonging to the history of a project.

More than one projects can share the same commits if one is a fork of the other.
